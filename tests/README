Test script format:

[optional flags]
file
md5 element-name
   .
   .
   .
md5 element-name


If no [optional flags] are needed, just leave that line out


There needs to be an md5 + element-name for each thing extracted
from the file.

For example, test3.t is

> -qa
> test3.mime
> bcbd311b883b54991582e1cd7a66fbc3  part.1
> 17b2e1b52f5d2f25c517be41ab4ae7cf  part.2

It has the optional flags -qa, it tests test3.mime, and the two
elements extracted from it are part.1 & part.2 (autogenerated
filenames; the option `a` has told unravel to extract everything,
even unnamed elements, from the file) which should have the given
md5sums.
