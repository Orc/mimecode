		    HOW TO BUILD AND INSTALL MIMECODE

1) Unpacking the distribution

The MIMECODE sources are distributed in tarballs.  After extracting from
the tarball, you should end up with all the source and build files in the
directory
		mimecode-(version)

2) Installing the distribution

MIMECODE uses configure.sh to set itself up for compilation.   To run
configure, just do ``./configure.sh'' and it will check your system for
build dependencies and build makefiles for you.   If configure.sh finishes
without complaint, you can then do a ``make'' to compile everything and a
``make install'' to install the binaries.

Configure.sh has a few options that can be set:

    --src=DIR		where the source lives (.)
    --prefix=DIR	where to install the final product (/usr/local)
    --execdir=DIR	where to put executables (prefix/bin)
    --libdir=DIR	where to put libraries (prefix/lib)
    --mandir=DIR	where to put manpages (prefix/man)
    --confdir=DIR	where to put configuration information (/etc)

    --enable-uuencode	build the uuencode/uudecode programs and manpages

Configure.sh attempts to guess whether to put manpages into $prefix/man
or $prefix/share/man.  This is fairly new code, so it may not get it
right.   Running ``make -n install'' will show you where it wants to
place the manpages.
