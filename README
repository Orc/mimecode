MIMECODE contains a mime packer, a mime unpacker, and (optionally)
a uuencode and uudecode that understand the newer base64 uuencode
format.

MIMECODE is free software;  it is released under a BSD-style license
that allows you to do as you wish with it as long as you don't attempt
to claim it as your own work.

Most of the programs included in the MIMECODE distribution have
manual pages describing how they work.

The file INSTALL describes how to build and install mimecode
