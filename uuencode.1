.Dt UUENCODE 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm uuencode ,
.Nd encode a binary file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl m
.Op Fl o Ar output_file
.Op Ar file
.Ar name
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
and
.Xr uudecode 1
utilities are used to transmit binary files over transmission mediums
that do not support other than simple
.Tn ASCII
data.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility reads
.Ar file
(or by default the standard input) and writes an encoded version
to the standard output, or
.Ar output_file
if one has been specified.
The encoding uses only printing
.Tn ASCII
characters and includes the
mode of the file and the operand
.Ar name
for use by
.Xr uudecode 1 .
.Pp
The following options are available for
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width ident
.It Fl m
Use the Base64 method of encoding, rather than the traditional
.Nm
algorithm.
.It Fl o Ar output_file
Output to
.Ar output_file
instead of standard output.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example packages up a source tree, compresses it,
uuencodes it and mails it to a user on another system.
When
.Xr uudecode 1
is run on the target system, the file
.Dq Ar src_tree.tar.Z
will be
created which may then be uncompressed and extracted into the original
tree.

.Xr compress 1 ,
.Xr mail 1 ,
.Xr uucp 1 ,
.Xr uudecode 1 ,
.Xr uuencode 5
.Sh BUGS
Files encoded using the traditional algorithm are expanded by 35% (3
bytes become 4 plus control information).
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm uudecode
and
.Nm
utilities appeared in
.Bx 4.0 .
