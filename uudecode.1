decodes the

attempting to retain the mode (except for setuid bits) of
the original file.
If a file of the same name exists, the file will have a sequence
number appended to it to avoid conflicts
(see

for exceptions.)
.Nm
ignores any leading and trailing lines.

.It Fl 7
Force filenames to 7-bit USASCII.

instead of to the filename specified on the

line.
